Teaching
======
* August 2014-May 2015: Teaching Assistant, Purdue University, West Lafayette 
  * Trained incoming PhD students and PhD students from other lab in molecular biology techniques, in
vivo imaging technique and in vitro drug response assays
  * Trained 2 undergraduate students in mammalian cell culture and 
uorescence microscopy, 1 graduate
student in Nanosight spectrocopy, TEM and SEM
  * I was in charge of training and maintaining Nanosight spectroscopy instrument in my lab which gener-
ated preliminary data for 3 grants and 4 peer reviewed Journal papers.
  * Designed in class activities for 400 level seminar course and executed them eciently and lead 2 inquiry-
based lab sections of 25 students by introducing concepts and experiments. Students publicized in-
creased academic condence and enthusiasm in other challenging science courses upon completion of
program.
